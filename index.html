<div id="MainText">Hello, my name is Kiren and I am a year 9 student at Merrylands High School. What you have infront of you is 3 lniks. The first one is my Angry birds portfolio. Where we had to make an 8-bit Angry Bird, then make a portfolio describing the charatcter. The second link is of my Flynn's Website. With this we had to make a website for Flynn from the Tron series. This was so he could use this website to sell his products and bring people to his arcade. The third link is of a very simple flash animation that we will be making in class. The reason why nothing is in there is because we haven't done it yet, but once we have completed the animation I will for sure put it in there.</div>
